Write safer code with SafeOperation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "safe_operation"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install safe_operation

## Usage

No monkey patch.

```ruby
class RecordNotFound < StandardError; end
class User def self.find(id); new; end; end;
class Guest; end
class Admin; def initialize(user); end; end
class SuperAdmin; def initialize(admin); end; end

operation = SafeOperation.run do
  User.find(1)
end

# Know if operation succeeded
operation.success?

# Get the value of the performed operation
operation.value

# Common patterns, reloaded
SafeOperation.run { User.find(1) }.value_or(Guest.new)

# Handling exceptions
SafeOperation.run { raise(RecordNotFound) }.value_or_else do |exception|
  if exception.is_a?(RecordNotFound)
    Guest.new
  else
    # logging, re-raise, etc.
  end
end

# Apply on first operation
operation = SafeOperation.
  run { User.find(1) }.
  and_then { |user| Admin.new(user) }

operation.value # #<Admin ...>

# Chainable
operation = SafeOperation.
  run { User.find(1) }.
  and_then { |user| Admin.new(user) }.
  and_then { |admin| SuperAdmin.new(admin) }

operation.value # #<SuperAdmin ...>

# Add or_else to handle failed operation
operation = SafeOperation.
  run { raise(RecordNotFound) }.
  and_then { |user| Admin.new(user) }.
  or_else { Guest.new }

operation.success? # => false
operation.value # => #<Guest ...>
```
